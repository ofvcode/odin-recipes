            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Butter: This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with
                    white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Eggs: Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Water: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the
                    cookies up.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies
                    taste salty.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Flour: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Chocolate chips: Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk
                    chocolate chips if you prefer.</li>


                </ul>
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                <li>Gather your ingredients, making sure your butter is softened, and your eggs are room temperature. </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Beat in eggs, one at a time, then stir in vanilla. </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Dissolve baking soda in hot water. Add to batter along with salt. </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Stir in flour, chocolate chips, and walnuts. </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are nicely browned, about 10 minutes. </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Cool on the baking sheets briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Store in an airtight container or serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
