                    1 large russet potato, cut into evenly sized strips
                    </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>vegetable oil for frying, about 2 cups or as needed
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
                <p></p>
 

                </ul>
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                <li>Soak potato strips in a large bowl of water for about 30 minutes. </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Pat with paper towels until thoroughly dry. </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Gently add potatoes to the hot oil and fry for about 5 minutes, stirring and flipping the potatoes occasionally. </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Use a slotted spoon to transfer potatoes to a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool completely. </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Heat oil again, but this time to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add potatoes and fry a second time until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Remove from the deep-fryer and blot with a paper towel. Sprinkle with salt to serve. </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Enjoy! </li>
                <p></p>
                </ol>
